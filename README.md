Some pregenerated 3D interactive plots of various unique orbit patterns can be found in the plots folder.

The html files can be opened in a web browser, though they are fairly large so they may take a few seconds to load.

The python source code is also provided if you are interested in generating your own plots. All the intialization variables are at the top few lines.

You can download all the files in this repository (https://github.com/Aidywady/Charge-Orbits/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and then open the plots folder and find the pregenerated html plot files. The zip file is fairly large: 300MB

For anybody unconvinced that these orbits can actually occur in the real world, here is a link to a cool YouTube video of a demo experiment done on the International Space Station (hosted on the NASA channel): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHrBhgwq__Q

Fun fact:
For the spheres and disks, the charges are evenly distributed in the same way as plants distribute leaves around an axis. It using the golden ratio! (1.618)
